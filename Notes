1- how do you create a paragraph using the <p> tag?
--? we can the create a paragraph by just writing the <p> followed by writing a opening tag and closing tag ,between these tags we can write some content , it shows on the browser as the content like the text.
2- Can you nest other HTML elements inside a <p> tag?
No,the <p> tag is a block -level element , and it cannot contain block-level elements like other paragraphs or headings.However you can include inline
elements like <strong> and <em>, and links.

<! -- TODO Now, we will see BR and HR Tag -->
break row and horizontal row ,create a horizontal line after the written text .
Note--
No matter how much whitespace you see inside HTML element content (which can include one or more space characters ,
but also line breaks), the HTML parser reduces each sequence of whitespace to a single space when rendering the code.
